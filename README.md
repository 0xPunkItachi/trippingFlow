# 💸 Peer Tipping Smart Contract

A simple **on-chain tipping mechanism** that allows users to reward their peers with ETH directly on the blockchain.  
This project is built for **Flow Blockchain (Testnet)** to demonstrate decentralized peer recognition and rewards.

---

## 🚀 Overview

The **Peer Tipping Contract** enables users to send ETH-based tips to peers in a decentralized and transparent manner.  
Each peer accumulates tips over time and can withdraw their total balance anytime.

This implementation uses **no imports**, **no constructors**, and **no input fields** — maintaining a minimal and secure smart contract structure.

---

## 🧠 Key Features

- **Send Tips:** Reward other users by sending ETH to the contract.  
- **Withdraw Tips:** Recipients can withdraw their accumulated tips anytime.  
- **View Balance:** Check how much tip balance you’ve received.  
- **Owner Controls:** The contract owner can perform an emergency withdrawal if needed.  
- **Event Tracking:** All activities are logged for transparency.

## ⚙️ Functions Overview

| Function | Description |
|-----------|--------------|
| `initialize()` | Sets the contract owner (only callable once). |
| `tipPeer()` | Sends ETH as a tip to a randomly assigned peer. |
| `withdrawTips()` | Withdraws the sender’s accumulated tip balance. |
| `getBalance()` | Returns the tip balance for the caller. |
| `emergencyWithdrawAll()` | Allows owner to withdraw all ETH in emergencies. |
| `receive()` | Accepts direct ETH transfers. |

---

## 📜 Example Flow

1. **Deploy Contract** on Flow Testnet.  
2. Call `initialize()` once to set your wallet as the owner.  
3. Anyone can call `tipPeer()` and send ETH to a peer.  
4. Recipients call `withdrawTips()` to receive their rewards.  
5. Owner can use `emergencyWithdrawAll()` if needed.

---

## 🧩 Technical Details

- **Language:** Solidity `^0.8.0`
- **Libraries:** None (pure Solidity)
- **Constructor:** None (manual `initialize()` used)
- **Randomness:** Simple pseudo-random peer generation (for demo)
- **Gas Efficient:** Minimal storage and logic

---

## 🌐 Flow Testnet Deployment

**Blockchain:** Flow (Testnet)  
**Contract Address:** `0xEBB5e4159aBb83cC6d6018b602b5F6bdDE8D40E2`

You can interact with this contract using Flow’s testnet tools or Remix IDE configured for Flow EVM testnet.

---

## 🔒 Security Notes

- This contract uses a pseudo-random function for demonstration.  
  In production, a secure randomness source like Chainlink VRF should be used.  
- Always verify contract source and owner before interacting.  
- Keep private keys secure when calling `initialize()`.

---

## 🧑‍💻 Example Usage (Remix)

1. Copy-paste the contract into Remix.
2. Select Solidity version `0.8.0`.
3. Deploy on Flow Testnet.
4. Run:
   - `initialize()` to set yourself as owner.
   - `tipPeer()` and send ETH as `msg.value`.
   - `withdrawTips()` to withdraw received tips.

---

## 📬 Events

| Event | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| `Initialized(address owner)` | Logs contract initialization. |
| `TipSent(address from, address to, uint256 amount)` | Emitted when a tip is sent. |
| `TipWithdrawn(address by, uint256 amount)` | Emitted when a peer withdraws tips. |
| `EmergencyWithdraw(address owner, uint256 amount)` | Logs emergency withdrawals by the owner. |
